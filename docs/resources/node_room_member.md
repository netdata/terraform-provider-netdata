# netdata_node_room_member (Resource)

Provides a Netdata Cloud Node Room Member resource. Use this resource to manage node membership to the room in the selected space.
There are two options to add nodes to the room:
- providing the node names directly, but only reachable nodes will be added to the room, use node_names attribute for this
- creating rules that will automatically add nodes to the room based on the rule, use rule block for this

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "netdata_node_room_member" "test" {
  space_id = "<space_id>"
  room_id  = "<room_id>"
  node_names = [
    "node1",
    "node2"
  ]
  rule {
    action      = "INCLUDE"
    description = "Description of the rule"
    clause {
      label    = "role"
      operator = "equals"
      value    = "parent"
      negate   = false
    }
    clause {
      label    = "environment"
      operator = "equals"
      value    = "production"
      negate   = false
    }
  }
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `room_id` (String) The Room ID of the space.
- `space_id` (String) Space ID of the member.

### Optional

- `node_names` (List of String) List of node names to add to the room. At least one node name is required.
- `rule` (Block List) The node rule to apply to the room. The logical relation between multiple rules is OR. More info [here](https://learn.netdata.cloud/docs/netdata-cloud/spaces-and-rooms/node-rule-based-room-assignment). (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--rule))

<a id="nestedblock--rule"></a>
### Nested Schema for `rule`

Required:

- `action` (String) Determines whether matching nodes will be included or excluded from the room. EXCLUDE action always takes precedence against INCLUDE. Valid values: INCLUDE or EXCLUDE.

Optional:

- `clause` (Block List) The clause to apply to the rule. The logical relation between multiple clauses is AND. It should be a least one clause. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--rule--clause))
- `description` (String) The description of the rule.

Read-Only:

- `id` (String) The ID of the rule.

<a id="nestedblock--rule--clause"></a>
### Nested Schema for `rule.clause`

Required:

- `label` (String) The host label to check.
- `negate` (Boolean) Negate the clause.
- `operator` (String) Operator to compare. Valid values: equals, starts_with, ends_with, contains.
- `value` (String) The value to compare against.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
#!/bin/sh

terraform import netdata_node_room_member.test space_id,room_id
```
